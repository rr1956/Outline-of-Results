If hypoxia alone was driving the observed signaling as hypoxia diminishes with respiratory adaptation to hypoxia, the overall signaling should diminish. That clearly does not happen.</div><li><div></div><ul><li>How to show this?</li></ul></li><li>Many physiological changes occur during adaptation to hypoxia, among those are 1) stimulation of erythropoiesis to raise HbMass and improve oxygen transport; 2) respiratory adaptation resulting in higher arterial PO2 and lower PCO2; and 3) improved physical performance. We show here key genes and transcription factors linked to each of these changes during the process of adaptation, and with retention of these traits after return for one week to sea level.</li></ul><div></div>
